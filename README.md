# word count command line app (coding-challenge)

My solution to this challenge [https://codingchallenges.fyi/challenges/challenge-wc](https://codingchallenges.fyi/challenges/challenge-wc)

## functional requirements

command: wc [OPTION]... [FILE]...

outputs: Print newline, word, and byte counts for each FILE
If multiple file: also prints a total line

### Notes

- A word is a non-zero-length sequence characters delimited by white space.
- With no FILE, or when FILE is -, read standard input.
